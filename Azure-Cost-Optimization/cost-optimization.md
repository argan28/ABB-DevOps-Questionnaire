## 1. Overview  
This document outlines cost optimization recommendations for Azure resources based on Azure Advisor's analysis.

### A. Rightsize Virtual Machines (VMs)  
**Issue:** Some VMs are underutilized (CPU < 5% usage).  
**Recommendation:**  
- Downgrade or resize VM SKU (Resize from `Standard_D4s_v4` â†’ `Standard_D4s_v4`).  
- Use Auto-Shutdown to stop non-production VMs after work hours.  

**Estimated Savings:** 1678.46 USD (50%)

### B. Delete Unused Resources  
**Issue:** Unused disks, snapshots, and public IPs are incurring charges.

### C. Optimize Azure Storage Costs  
**Issue:** Some storage accounts are using Premium/Hot Tier, but data is rarely accessed.  
**Recommendation:**

**Estimated Savings:** 1344.36 USD

### D. Use Azure Reservations & Savings Plans  
**Issue:** Pay-as-you-go pricing is increasing cloud costs.
